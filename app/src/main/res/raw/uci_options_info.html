<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"></head><body><big>This is an editor that can be used to change UCI options that have been defined by an engine.<br>
<br>
The engine provides a default value for each option, which can be
changed here in an edit field. The option name is displayed in either
yellow (default) or white (change) text color. When you select the
option name, a changed value is reset to the default value.<br>
<br>
Button control:<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Info: </span>this documentation<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Cancel:</span> the saved data is retained<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Reset:</span> all options are reset to the default value<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">OK:</span> the options are saved and will take effect the next time the engine is started<br>
<br>
Some engines offer the option of using additional files (e.g. nnue, weights) to improve the playing strength of the engine.<br>
If the option name contains the text <span style="font-weight: bold;">"file"</span>, an additional file can be activated as follows:<br>
1) with a file manager, copy the file in a subdirectory (or newly created directory) of: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Android / data / ccc.chess.gui.chessforall / files / engines</span><br>
2) select the previously copied file in the option's edit field<br>
3) press the OK button<br>
<br>
A detailed description of the UCI options can be found in the documentation of the respective chess engine.</big><br>
